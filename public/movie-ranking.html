<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>Unique story with good animation. 
I really love how they tells the story.
Also I love their creatures, like cat bus, and the big chonk cat.
The music is really good and gives you a better mood while watching it.

<h3>Josee, the Tiger and the Fish</h3>
<p>A student that likes diving and in need of money decided to work.
Unexpectedly, he worked to look after a young girl in wheelchair.
I really like the story and the interaction of these two characters.
Music is as always gives you a better mood and feels towards this movie.
If there is the after story about this movie I would like to watch it because
the story was hanging.

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The story is about outspace, galaxy, time, and others.
Although I don't really understand what the movie is but you will learn
new things here like what does black hole looks like, what does other planet
looks like and many more. The music and the CGI of this is great and makes
you want to watch more and more.
